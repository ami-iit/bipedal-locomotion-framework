/**
 * YarpSensorBridge Yarp implementation of the ISensorBridge interface
 * Currently available interfaces
 * - Remapped Remote Control Board for joint states
 * - Inertial Measurement Units through generic sensor interface and remapped multiple analog sensor interface
 * - Whole Body Dynamics Estimated end effector wrenches through a generic sensor interface
 * - Force Torque Sensors through analog sensor interface and remapped multiple analog sensor interface
 * - Depth Cameras through RGBD sensor interface
 * - Camera images through OpenCV Grabber interface
 *
 * The YarpSensorBridge expects a list of device drivers through the yarp::dev::PolyDriverList object.
 * Each PolyDriver object in the list is compared with the configured sensor names and the assumptions listed below
 * to infer the sensor types and relevant interfaces in order to to read the relevant data.
 *
 * MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS
 * - Every sensor unit(device driver) attached to this Bridge is identified by a unique name
 * - A single instance of a remote control board remapper and a multiple analog sensor remapper is expected if the suer wants to use the control board interfaces and multiple analog sensor interfaces
 * - Any generic sensor interface with channel dimensions of 6 is considered to be a cartesian wrench interface
 * - Any generic sensor interface with channel dimensions of 12 is considered as a IMU interface (server inertial)
 * - Any analog sensor interface with channel dimensions of 6 is considered as a force torque sensor interface
 * - The current internal design (read all sensors in a serial fashion) may not be suitable for a heavy measurement set
 *
 * The parameters for writing the configuration file for this class is given as,
