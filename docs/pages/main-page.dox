\section mandatory-dependencies üìÑ Mandatory dependencies
The **bipedal-locomotion-framework** project is versatile and can be used to compile only some components.

The minimum required dependencies are `Eigen3`, `iDynTree` and `spdlog`. If you want to build the tests please remember to install `Catch2`. If you are interested in the python bindings generation please install `python3` and `pybind11` in your system.


\section exported-components üìô Exported components

The **bipedal-locomotion-framework** project consists of several components. The components are stored in the [`src`](https://github.com/ami-iit/bipedal-locomotion-framework/tree/master/src) folder and their compilation depends on the installed dependencies.

\warning ‚ö†Ô∏è  Including `BipedalLocomotion/Framework.h` may result in higher compilation time because of the inclusion of headers which may not be used in your project. It is always suggested to follow the [IWYU](https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use/blob/cc0fad4be0db26e40713b6076263f204a311b573/docs/WhyIWYU.md) paradigm. This applies also for the CMake targets. It is suggested to link only the targets used in your project.

\section install-with-conda üì¶ Install with conda (recommended)
You can easily the library with [`conda`](https://anaconda.org/robotology/bipedal-locomotion-framework) using the following command

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
conda install -c robotology bipedal-locomotion-framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`conda` will automatically install all the required dipendencies.

\section build-the-suite üõ†Ô∏è Build the suite
The **bipedal-locomotion-framework**  can be built on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The easiest way to compile the library is to use the [`robotology-superbuild`](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild). If you enable the profiles  `ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS` and `ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS_FULL_DEPS` in the `robotology-superbuild` you will automatically clone and build **bipedal-locomotion-framework** and all the dependencies.

If you do not want to use the `robotology-superbuild` you can manually compile the code in the repository running the following command in the terminal

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/ami-iit/bipedal-locomotion-framework.git
cd bipedal-locomotion-framework
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/where/you/want/to/install> \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\warning ‚ö†Ô∏è  If you manually compile the framework remember to install the dependencies required by the component you are interested in.

\section some-utilities üñ•Ô∏è  Some utilities

The **bipedal-locomotion-framework** ships also some utilities that can help you in the everyday tests on a real robot. You can find them in the [`utilities` folder](https://github.com/ami-iit/bipedal-locomotion-framework/tree/master/utilities). Each utility contains a well-documented `README` where you can find further details.

\section python üêç Python

\b bipedal-locomotion-framework provides also python bindings. Only a small set of the components implemented in the library have the corresponding python bindings.

If you want to compile the bindings please install `python3` and `pybind11` in your system then you can run the following `CMake` command in your `build` folder. You also need to install [`manifpy`](https://github.com/artivis/manif/releases/tag/0.0.4).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/where/you/want/to/install> \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DFRAMEWORK_COMPILE_PYTHON_BINDINGS:BOOL=ON \
      -DPython3_ROOT_DIR=$(python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.prefix)") \
      -DFRAMEWORK_USE_Python3:BOOL=ON \
      -DFRAMEWORK_USE_pybind11:BOOL=ON .
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\warning ‚ö†Ô∏è  The python bindings are currently supported on Linux.

\note You can find further information regarding the `python` bindings in \ref python-additional-info

\section how-to-use-the-libraries üèÉ How to use the libraries
\b bipedal-locomotion-framework provides native `CMake` support which allows the library to be easily used in `CMake` projects.

\b bipedal-locomotion-framework exports the `CMake` targets presented in Exported components section. The targets can be imported using the `find_package`  command and used by calling `target_link_libraries`.

For instance, `Math` component can be used as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cmake}
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
project(myproject)
find_package(BipedalLocomotionFramework COMPONENTS Math REQUIRED)
add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE BipedalLocomotion::Math)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The list of the targets can be found in the table \ref exported-components

\section contributing ‚öôÔ∏è  Contributing

The **bipedal-locomotion-framework** is an open-source project, and is thus built with your contributions. We strongly encourage you to open an issue with your feature request. Once the issue has been opened, you can also proceed with a pull-request üöÄ
