# :page_facing_up: Mandatory dependencies
The **bipedal-locomotion-framework** project is versatile and can be used to compile only some components.

The minimum required dependencies are `Eigen3`, `iDynTree` and `spdlog`. If you want to build the tests please remember to install `Catch2`. If you are interested in the Python bindings generation please install `python3` and `pybind11` in your system.

# :orange_book: Exported components
The **bipedal-locomotion-framework** project consists of several components. The components are stored in the [`src`](./src) folder and their compilation depends on the installed dependencies.

:warning: Including `BipedalLocomotion/Framework.h` may result in higher compilation time because of the inclusion of headers which may not be used in your project. It is always suggested to follow the [IWYU](https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use/blob/cc0fad4be0db26e40713b6076263f204a311b573/docs/WhyIWYU.md) paradigm. This applies also to the CMake targets. It is suggested to link only the targets used in your project.

# :package: Install with conda (recommended)
You can easily the library with [`conda`](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/bipedal-locomotion-framework) using the following command

```console
conda install -c conda-forge bipedal-locomotion-framework
```

`conda` will automatically install all the required dependencies.


# :hammer: Build the suite
The **bipedal-locomotion-framework**  can be built on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The easiest way to compile the library is to use the [`robotology-superbuild`](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild). If you enable the profiles  `ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS` and `ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS_FULL_DEPS` in the `robotology-superbuild` you will automatically clone and build **bipedal-locomotion-framework** and all the dependencies.

If you do not want to use the `robotology-superbuild` you can manually compile the code in the repository by running the following command in the terminal

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ami-iit/bipedal-locomotion-framework.git
cd bipedal-locomotion-framework
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/where/you/want/to/install> \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```

**Remark:** If you manually compile the framework remember to install the dependencies required by the component you are interested in.

# :computer: Some utilities
The **bipedal-locomotion-framework** ships also some utilities that can help you in the everyday tests on a real robot. You can find them in the [`utilities` folder](./utilities). Each utility contains a well-documented` README` where you can find further details.

# :snake: Python
**bipedal-locomotion-framework** also provides Python bindings. Only a small set of the components implemented in the library have the corresponding Python bindings.

If you want to compile the bindings please install `python3` and `pybind11` in your system then you can run the following `CMake` command in your `build` folder

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/where/you/want/to/install> \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DFRAMEWORK_COMPILE_PYTHON_BINDINGS:BOOL=ON \
      -DPython3_ROOT_DIR=$(python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.prefix)") \
      -DFRAMEWORK_USE_Python3:BOOL=ON \
      -DFRAMEWORK_USE_pybind11:BOOL=ON .
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```

**Disclaimer:** The Python bindings are currently supported on Linux.

# :running: How to use the libraries
The **bipedal-locomotion-framework** provides native `CMake` support which allows the library to be easily used in `CMake` projects.

**bipedal-locomotion-framework** exports the `CMake` targets presented in the [Exported components](#orange_book-exported-components) section. The targets can be imported using the `find_package` command and used by calling `target_link_libraries`.

For instance, the `Math` component can be used as follows:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
project(myproject)
find_package(BipedalLocomotionFramework COMPONENTS Math REQUIRED)
add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE BipedalLocomotion::Math)
```

The list of the targets can be found in the table [:orange\_book: Exported components](#orange_book-exported-components).
